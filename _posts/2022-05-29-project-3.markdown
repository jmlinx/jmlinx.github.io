description: Bootstrap percolation in (random) graphs is a contagion dynamics among a set of vertices with certain threshold levels. The process is started by a set of initially infected vertices, and an initially uninfected vertex with threshold k gets infected as soon as the number of its infected neighbors exceeds k. This process has been studied extensively in so called \textit{rank one} models. These models can generate random graphs with heavy-tailed degree sequences but they are not capable of clustering. In this paper, we treat a class of random graphs of unbounded rank which allow for extensive clustering. Our main result determines the final fraction of infected vertices as the fixed point of a non-linear operator defined on a suitable function space. We propose an algorithm that facilitates neural networks to calculate this fixed point efficiently. We further derive criteria based on the Fr√©chet derivative of the operator that allows one to determine whether small infections spread through the entire graph or rather stay local.
